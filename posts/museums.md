1. The [National Museum of Print](http://museudaimprensa.pt/) (Museu Nacional da Imprensa), aims to record and recuperate Portugal's typographic and print heritage.

   There is a permanent historical collection covering: type-foundry, type-setting, printing, and binding. It includes collections of punches, matrices and moulds for manual execution of type, a French machine of the brand _Foucher_, from 1906; a collection of typographic vignettes, used in the decoration and layout of the pages, as well as instruments such as composing sticks, galleys, and chases indispensable to the work of composition. There are two _Linotype_ machines, the *Monotype* and _Typograph_; an 18th century wooden printing press, restored by the museum; a British *Albion Press* and a *Stanhope* of the French brand _Alauzet_, all in working order. There are other printing machines of the brands _Minerva_, *Johannisberg*, and _Marinoni_; a wooden lithographic press in wood from the nineteenth century, with its typical star wheel, accompanied by some lithographic stones; a manually operated German *Mansfeld* and an enormous four column binding press.

   There is also a permanent exhibition celebrating _Rodrigo Álvares_, a Portuguese printer who in 1497 was using the technique of movable type, developed by Gutenberg in Germany about 50 years before. He printed two books in Porto at the request of the bishop of Porto, _D. Diogo de Sousa_, and is considered the &ldquo;Portuguese Gutenberg&rdquo;.

   A unique new permanent exhibition, comprising some 160 miniature typographic pieces, shows the evolution of the media from Gutenberg to the present day. The pieces were produced by _Américo da Silveira_, a printer who studied in the workshops of São José in Porto, and spent 40 years constructing the miniatures. For this purpose he visited several printing machinery factories, mainly German, and corresponded with many companies to replicate the details of the machines he was reproducing.

2. The [Portuguese Center of Photography - Centro Português de Fotografia (CPF)](https://cpf.pt/) in Porto is housed in a former prison, dating from 1767. The permanent exhibition contains rare examples of daguerreotypes, field and studio cameras; folding bellows, 35mm and twin-lens reflex cameras, including _Rolleis_ and _Hasselblad_; a room devoted to _Kodak_ and a collection of spy cameras and miniatures. There is also an example of an _Escopette_ of Darier and an _Ermanox_, and a variety of photographic materials and equipment: flashes, exposure meters, chemicals and laboratory equipment. The center has regular exhibitions of photography and now 15,000 photographic images from the cpf archive are [available online](https://digitarq.arquivos.pt/).
